## Parent Coach Tips
- Keep it playful. Let kids “teach back” in their own words.  
- Praise the habit, not perfection.  
- Use examples, not real passwords or personal info.

## 🐍 Optional: Try the Password Checker (Python)

If you want to try something “techy”:

1. Click the green **Code** button → **Download ZIP** and unzip it.  
2. Open the folder on your computer.  
3. Double-click the file `password_checker.py` (if your computer is set up for Python 3)  
   *or* open a terminal/command prompt in that folder and type:


(or on Windows sometimes just `python scripts/password_checker.py`)

4. Type **example** passwords (never real ones).  
5. Read the friendly feedback.
