# Mission 2: Photo Privacy Check 📷

**Goal:** Make a family rule for safe photo sharing.  

### Steps
1. Before posting a photo, ask:
   - Does it show a school name, street, or location?  
   - Is private info in the background (calendar, mail, badge)?  
   - Does everyone in the photo agree to share it?  

### Family Rule
> “We only share photos that don’t reveal our location or private info.”
