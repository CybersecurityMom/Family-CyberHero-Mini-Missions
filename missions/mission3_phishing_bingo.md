# Mission 3: Phishing Bingo 🎯

**Goal:** Spot common red flags in messages.  

### Red Flags
- Urgent: “Act NOW!”  
- Strange sender or URL  
- Spelling mistakes  
- Attachments you didn’t expect  
- Asking for passwords or codes  
- “You won a prize!”  
- Links that don’t match the site  
- Generic greeting: “Dear user”  
- Pressure to reply fast  

### Game
Make a 3x3 bingo grid on paper.  
Show pretend messages. Kids shout “Bingo!” when they spot 3 red flags.

🎉 High-five moment: Kids make one anti-phish rule for the fridge.
