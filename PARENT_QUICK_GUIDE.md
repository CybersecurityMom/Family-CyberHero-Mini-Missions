🤝 Parent Coach Tips

Keep it playful. Let your child “teach back” what they learned.

Praise the habit, not perfection.

Don’t use real personal info or real passwords in examples.

📝 Family Pledge

Read this out loud together:

“We protect our data like treasure.
We pause before we click.
We choose passwords with power.
We ask for help when things feel off.”

👉 That’s it! Do one mission at a time, celebrate with a high-five, and let your child become a CyberHero.
